            <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
            <p>WhatsApp Replay ("the Service") is fundamentally designed to be a privacy-first application. We believe your conversations are your own, and our core principle is to never access, view, store, or transmit your personal chat data.</p>
            
            <h2>Data Processing</h2>
            <p>All processing of your exported WhatsApp chat files (.txt) is performed locally within your web browser. The file you select is not uploaded to our servers or any third-party service. It is opened and read directly by the JavaScript code running on the webpage. When you close the browser tab, the data is gone.</p>

            <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
            <p>We do not collect, log, or have access to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The content of your chat files.</li>
                <li>Personal information from within your chats, such as names, phone numbers, or messages.</li>
                <li>Any files on your computer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Information We Might Collect</h2>
            <p>We may use anonymous analytics tools (like a self-hosted Plausible or Fathom) to collect non-personal, aggregated data about website usage. This may include the number of visitors, session duration, and country of origin. This data helps us understand how the service is being used and how to improve it. It is never linked to any personal information.</p>
            
            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
